# ft_printf

My implementation of the library function printf. 
Printf format string refers to a control parameter used by a class of functions in the input/output libraries of C and many other programming languages. The string is written in a simple template language: characters are usually copied literally into the function's output, but format specifiers, which start with a % character, 
indicate the location and method to translate a piece of data (such as a number) to characters.

Do "make" --> "make test" (you can change the examples in run/printf.c or uncomment different lines)
then use : "./ft_ptintf"
